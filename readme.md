## Full stack challenge

### A simple -yet functional- account manager app (crud)

#### Note:
This documentation is based on a machine with windows 10. Since most of the commands are python and npm / node, these will not vary based on your OS but keep in mind that they will change commands such as assigning environment variables.

### Summary
The repository was structured like this just to have a one repository with all the code. The two 'apps' are intended to run separately.

### Core dependencies
* Python 3.x.x [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python page")
* PostgreSQL [postgresql.org/download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/ "Download PostgreSQL page")
* Node/NPM [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/es/download/ "Download Node page")

### General setup
There are some extra steps before jumping into the client and server folders and run the applications.
1. Create the database:
   1. Open `cmd` and run `createdb <dbname>`.

The **instructions** to run each app are within its folders.
